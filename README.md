SA8 was extremely confusing to me. Finally finished but it took so much time for me sadly.
The backend was giving me some major issues that it took me hours to figure out. Some of these fixes ended up being only 1 line long which really aggravated me. 

Feels great now that I finished though. Authentication is no easy job. 

## What Worked Well
It took a little while for me to figure out how to get all of the endpoints working, and the syntax was definitely funny at times. However, I was eventually able to get each method to work with a bit of trial and error. It's cool to see how the full stack comes together. 

## What Didn't
Deploying with Heroku was confusing too. I still don't completely understand how Mongo and Heroku work together, but I think i get the main idea behind it. 

## Screenshots
Not many screenshots would be helpful for this lab. You can check out the link to my heroku and surge pages above.
